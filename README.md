# Forecasting-Payment-Transactions-A-Support-Vector-Regression-Approach
This mini_project  demonstrates the Transaction amount prediction for different Clients(Id_compte) by date using Support Vector Regression (SVR).
**The steps are explained very well in the notebook.**

**About the dataset :**

You are provided with a comprehensive dataset from a leading fintech company, capturing a detailed record of client transactions over a period of one year. This dataset presents a unique opportunity to explore, analyze, and forecast financial behaviors in a real-world context.

this data contains 4 column : 

**Date**: The exact date and time when the transaction occurred, providing a granular view of transaction patterns over time.
**Id_compte**: A unique identifier for each client account, allowing analysis of transactions on an account-by-account basis.
**amount_transaction**: The monetary value of the transaction, which is the primary target variable for your forecasting models.
**category_transaction**: The category of each transaction (e.g., Food & Drink, Bank Transfers), offering insights into spending behavior and transaction types.
